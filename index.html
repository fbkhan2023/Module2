            <p class="tag1">Mango</p>
            <p>Mango is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and it has been associated with many health
                benefits, including potential anticancer effects, as well as improved immunity and digestive and eye
                health. Best of all, it's tasty and easy to add to your diet as part of smoothies and many other dishes.

            <p class="tag2">Apple</p>
            <p>Apples are a good source of nutrients, including fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants which can help
                support healthy digestion, brain health, and weight management. There is evidence that apples can also
                protect against certain chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <p class="tag3">Grapes</p>
            <p>Grapes are a good source of potassium, a mineral that helps balance fluids in your body. Potassium can
                help bring down high blood pressure and lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people don't
                get enough of this nutrient, so eating grapes can help fill the gap.</p>
